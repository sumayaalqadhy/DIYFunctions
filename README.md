# DIY Functions 

**Objective**

This is a short exercise in Kotlin to help practice writing and utilizing different functions. It's a short program that asks a user to enter 7 values and find the largest, smallest, and average of the values entered. It also accepts user input to check if a value exists in the list and return a statement based on that.
